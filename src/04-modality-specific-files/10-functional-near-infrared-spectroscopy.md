# Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy

Support for Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was developed as a
[BIDS Extension Proposal](../07-extensions.md#bids-extension-proposals).
Please see [Citing BIDS](../01-introduction.md#citing-bids)
on how to appropriately credit this extension when referring to it in the
context of the academic literature.

Several [example fNIRS datasets](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples) have been formatted using this specification
and can be used for practical guidance when curating a new dataset.
